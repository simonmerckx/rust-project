## Extra

I made extra tests for every part I implemented. I usually tested behaviour of the more complicated functions that  
was not checked in the provided tests. The structure of my test is heavily based on the provided tests.

## Feedback on the Project 

I lost quite a bit of time trying to get rust working and understanding the provided
code. It was also not easy to find the right information about certain aspects 
of rust online. I did learn a lot about the language by doing the project.
