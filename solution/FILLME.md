## Feedback on the Project 

I 'lost' quite a bit of time trying to get rust working and understanding the provided
code. It was also not easy to find the right information about certain aspects 
of rust online. I did learn a lot about the language by doing the project.

After working on this project for such a long time, you're allowed to vent in this
section. Tell us what you learned or what you would've liked to learn instead,
etc. This does not count toward your grades at all (neither positive nor negative).
